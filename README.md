# E-Commerce-backend

## Description
This project was enjoyable yet challenging. I thoroughly enjoyed putting codes together with an understanding of them, but was challenged in excecuting ceratin codes successfully at first.

I was able to accomplish this project through research and using similar classwork activities as my guide. 
## Illustration
Step 1: Start by creating a server.js and working on the configuration folder to make sure your connections are set.
Step 2: Create a db folder with schema.sql with the Database name.
Step 3: Work on your projects models according to their functionality/purpose. These will link to your db.
Step 4: Work on your routes. These are essential in making your routes function.
Step 5: Have your seeds set.
Step 6: create a dotenv file containing Username, password and db name of your mysql.
Step 7: Open Integrated terminal and install all installation needed, open your mysql then npm run seed and finally node server.js to get your backend codes to run.
